# Exercise: Blog posts


## How it was done
* To keep it easy to handle, I did not use any JS bundler and wrote plain HTML & CSS. 
* To have a look on the result, just open the index.html with a browser and a working internet connection.
* As required, I used the Vanilla framework and the given JSON data.
* To fetch the JSON, the plain JS fetch function was used
* To make life a bit easier (and because I wanted to learn something new), I used AlpineJS to render the fetched data.

## Decisions
* I tried to make the design of the posts similar to the given Screenshot.
* Nonetheless, the given link colors do not fit 100% to the guidelines given by Canonical. 
* E.g. the link color on the picture is a little bit to bright, I decided to stick with the default color given by the framework and the palette.
